# To PRD

Turn the current conversation context and codebase understanding into a PRD. Do NOT interview the user — just synthesize what you already know.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already.

2. Sketch out the major modules you will need to build or modify to complete the implementation. Actively look for opportunities to extract deep modules that can be tested in isolation.

   Check with the user that these modules match their expectations. Check which modules they want tests written for.

3. Write the PRD using the template below, then publish it to the project issue tracker if configured.

## PRD Template

```markdown
## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each in the format:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

This list should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules
- Technical clarifications
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets — they go stale fast.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype.

## Testing Decisions

- What makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

Things that are out of scope for this PRD.

## Further Notes

Any additional notes about the feature.
